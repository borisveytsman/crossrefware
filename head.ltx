\section{Introduction}

These scripts can be used to submit files to Crossref, check and add
doi numbers, MathSciNet numbers and ZbMath numbers to papers, and to
convert `bbl' files to `bib' files.

I am grateful to Josko Plazonic from Princeton Math Dept whose
(unpublished) Python script was an inspiration for this suite.

The script \path{ltx2crossrefxml} is used to extract the information
from a \LaTeX\ file and generate an XML file suitable for submission
to Crossref (the organization that keeps DOI numbering system).  

Several scripts, \path{bibdoiadd}, \path{bibmradd} and \path{bibmradd}
take a \path{bib} file, and add to each entry a DOI, MR or ZBL number
correspondingly, if they can find this entry in the corresponding
database.   

Script \path{bbl2bib} tries to reconstruct a \path{bib} file from the
corresponding \path{thebibliography} environment.  One can argue that
this operation is akin to reconstructing a cow from the steak.  The
way the script does it is searching for the entry in the MR database,
and creating the corresponding Bib\TeX\ fields.

Below are manual pages for these scripts.
