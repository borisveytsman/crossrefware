			 Crossrefware Bundle
			  version 2017/11/26


Scripts useful for working with Crossref, MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.

This work was commissioned by The Saint Lois University and The
Princeton University (Mathematics Department)

bibdoiadd.pl       - add DOI numbers to papers in a given bib file
bibzbladd.pl       - add Zbl numbers to papers in a given bib file
bibmradd.pl        - add MR  numbers to papers in a given bib file
bbl2bib.pl         - convert `thebibliography' environment to a bib file
biburl2doi.pl      - convert urls pointing to doi.org to dois
ltx2crossrefxml.pl - a tool for creation of XML files for submitting to crossref.org

The scripts use bibtexperllibs libraries from CTAN

2.  Use *.cfg files as configuration files samples.

3.  Move *.1 to the man pages directory in your system.
