			 Crossrefware Bundle
			  version 2021-01-18

Scripts useful for working with Crossref, MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.

bibdoiadd.pl       - add DOI numbers to papers in a given bib file
bibzbladd.pl       - add Zbl numbers to papers in a given bib file
bibmradd.pl        - add MR  numbers to papers in a given bib file
bbl2bib.pl         - convert `thebibliography' environment to a bib file
biburl2doi.pl      - convert urls pointing to doi.org to dois
ltx2crossrefxml.pl - create XML files for submission to crossref.org

Bug reports, source code: https://github.com/borisveytsman/crossrefware
Releases: https://ctan.org/pkg/crossrefware

These scripts rely on the bibtexperllibs libraries (replace
/crossrefware with /bibtexperllibs in the above urls).

For an example of using ltx2crossrefxml and associated code, see the
TUGboat processing at
https://github.com/TeXUsersGroup/tugboat/tree/trunk/capsules/crossref.

Installation:
1.  Move *.pl files to the binaries directory in your system.
2.  Use *.cfg files as configuration files samples.
3.  Move *.1 to the man pages directory in your system.

This work was commissioned by The Saint Louis University and
Princeton University (Mathematics Department). Thank you!

Changes:

2021-01-18    - all conversions moved from ltx2crossrefxml to LaTeX::ToUnicode.
	      - config file can provide a hook for processing.

2018/04/15    - Fixed a bug in bibzbladd
	      - Work around a bug in mathscinet

2017/11/26    - Switched to date-based versioning for the bundle. 
              - bbl2bib now converts urls starting with
                http(s)://(dx.)doi.org to dois.  This functionality
	        is also provided by a separate script biburl2doi
	      - bibadddoi now has the option to (not) canonize names

Version 2.2:  We now treat absent CA permissively.
	      New debug options for bbl2bib

Version 2.1a: Bug in bbl2bib corrected

Version 2.1:  New options to add empty doi and zbl when doi or zbl
	      are not found to prevent repeated searches.
	      Added bibmradd.pl
	      Added bbl2bib.pl

Version 2.0:  Moved to BibTeX::Parser suite.
              Now we use new Zbmath interface.
              Now we use bibtexperllibs libraries
